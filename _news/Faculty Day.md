Young blood at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science during [**the 16th edition of the Faculty Day**](https://matinf.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/aktualnosci/-/journal_content/56_INSTANCE_SaA7HRzna0dW/41633/155715167)! 


So many inspiring lectures, fruitful discussions and workshops including mine conducted together with [**Zolt√°n Varga**]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/zolt%C3%A1n-gy%C3%B6rgy-varga-832aa01b0/?locale=pl_PL). _Complex social systems simulation at the example of road traffic_occured to be very vivid theme for all participants. Such brainstorming atmosphere drives us to continue action. I am very proud I could be the part of this initiative.
