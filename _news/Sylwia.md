🗞 _Complex social systems simulations – human behavior modeling_, lecture on [**Friday at Auditorium Maximum**]( https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7178375135991631873/)


I will be talking about how challenging is introducing the human factor into models and simulations · considering humans have their unpredictability and free will what makes simulations more complex. · The main question is how do we incorporate these aspects into modeling. · Together with the audience I will go on a journey through various examples, · from road traffic to pedestrian traffic simulations, presenting how human decisions can shape social phenomena. · Finally, I will show how to use artificial intelligence in simulations where people · compete for limited resources with intelligent machines.

See you there!
