I research complex social systems: **urban mobility**. Congested, urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations and leaving huge sets of mobility traces ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control. 

Currently, as an **Assistant Professor** in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of **Jagiellonian University** in Krakow (Poland) I am part of the **Group of Machine Learning Research** [GMUM](http://www.gmum.net). I run the *NCN Opus Grant* on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times and run a team to research complex social systems of urban mobility within the [DigiWorld](https://id.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/digiworld) scheme. We are now a team of two PhDs and me - to be followed with a PostDoc soon.

Before, I worked (2019-2021) with Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant [Critical MaaS](http://smartptlab.tudelft.nl/projects/criticalmaas). I model two-sided mobility platforms, specifcally focusing on ride-pooling (making people share their Uber with co-travellers). I did PhD with Guido Gentile in non-equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment. In the interdisciplinary field of _urban mobility_ I did research which can be classified as: 
* model estimation, optimization, system control, network design;
* agent-based simulation, game-theory, network science, stochastic simulation, epidemic modelling;
* machine learning, spatial analysis, big data analysis, pattern recognition, unsupervised learning;
* behavioural modelling, economic discrete choice models, policy, sustainability.

Outside of academia I was: 
* Data Scientist at [NorthGravity](https://www.northgravity.com/about_us) developing AWS-based protfolio or real-time production ready ML solutions
* R&D Developer at PTV SISTeMA implementing algorithms into [PTV Optima](https://www.ptvgroup.com/en/solutions/products/ptv-optima/) real-time  traffic forecasting models.
* Transport Modeller at [Department of Transportation Systems](http://www.kst.pk.edu.pl/) using travel-diaries to estimate demand models and create strategic planning tools, e.g. for [Warsaw](http://transport.um.warszawa.pl/warszawskie-badanie-ruchu-2015/model-ruchu) and [Kraków](http://knsk.org/2015/01/krakowski-model-ruchu-2014/)
