We have three open positions in the field of Urban Mobility and Machine Learning - modelling and optimizing the complexity of urban travel in presence of emerging modes (shared-mobility, ride-hailing, etc.) and post-pandemic safety issues.


Positions (funded by the NCN OPUS personal grant with a competitive salary are interdisciplinary, originating from transport systems but directed towards a number of exciting interdisciplinary fields, e.g. Network Science, Reinforcerment Learning, Social Systems and Data Science.



You will be based in the charming city of Krakow (one of top 10 tourist destination in Europe) at the Jagiellonian University (est. 1364, with Nicolaus Copernicus among alumni, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km61cWOsF4M)). The project will be run at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science within a strong ecosystem of DataScience, Machine Learning and Optimization groups. Together with the [PI](rafalkucharskiPK.github.io) you will work on this [project](https://www.ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/files/listy-rankingowe/2020-03-16pfoa/streszczenia/480109-en.pdf).

We are looking for prospective candidates to develop research into the following directions: 

### PostDoc

You will work with recent disruptive changes of urban mobility, focusing on two-sided mobility platforms. You will apply and develop our in-house algorithms ([ExMAS](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS) and [MaaSSim](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim)) and cutting edge external sofwares (e.g. [FLOW](https://flow-project.github.io/)). 

* You will work in the small core team of PI, yourself and two PhDs and thus will receive direct and supportive supervision. 
* Your benchmark perofrmance will be directed towards boosting your CV (to secure long-term emplyability). We expect you to submit two first-authored Q1 papers in a year. The team has ambition to publish in high-impact transportation journals (TR:B, TR:C), ML conferences (ICML, KDD, NeurIPS) and inter-disciplinary journals (PLOS One, Scientific Reports, etc.). 
* You will work within a strong machine-learning lab [GMUM](www.gmum.net) of 20+ reserarchers with great hands-on experience in Deep Learning, NLP, RL, etc. 
* You will be part of interdisciplinary DigiWorld group addressing challenges of digitalization (from social, theoretical and technological perspectives). 
* You will join core ecosystem of transportation engineering (TU Delft, DTU, etc.). 
* You will receive support in personal grants writing. 
* You will have no teaching obligations.
* You will have stable 24 months funding (ca. double the mean salary in Poland) sufficient to support you and family in Krakow.

Possible research areas:
* shareability graphs of ride-pooling (network science analysis)
* behavioural aspects of ride-pooling (discrete choice analysis)
* reinforcement learning in two-sided mobility markets (agents adaptations)
* control stategies for virus spreading in multi-layered complex networks
* or similar - to be brainstormed with PI.

We offer a 2-year position (extensible to 3-years) with a competitive salary (6000 PLN net - which is ca. double the average in Poland). 

Please share your CV and a brief cover letter at rafal.kucharski@uj.edu.pl - we will contact selected candidates for a brief talk.


~~### 1: Contact networks of emerging urban mobility modes - modelling, design and simulation~~

~~You will reconstruct and analyse contact networks emerging in ride-sharing systems (WP2). You will apply existing and develop new models to match mobility demand into pooled rides. You will employ epidemic models on the networks. You will apply behavioural findings from WP1 and translate them into network connectivity. You will run multi-dimensional stochastic simulations of various network and demand settings to quantify and synthesize virus exposure in shared mobility. In WP3 you will propose methods that will limit spreading and eventually halt it.~~

~~We are looking for enthusiastic and motivated applicants with a background in networks and data. Open-minded applicants ready to apply their skill on the interdisciplinary ground (mobility, behaviour, epidemics, network science, data analytics) welcomed. The candidate should hold a STEM masters degree (preferably Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or Engineering), shall have basic coding and data analysis skills. Fluent reading and writing English is essential for this position.


### 2: Reveal, understand and model post-pandemic travel behaviour towards emerging mobility models.

You will study travellers behaviour in urban mobility (WP1). In the rapidly changing landscape of urban mobility, you shall aim to track the emerging trends, identify dynamics in behaviour to precisely define market shares and target groups for future shared mobility. In the abundance of recent, corona-related research in mobility, you shall synthesize the latest theories, studies and findings to underpin our shared-mobility models. You shall conduct behavioural studies. Both revealed and stated preference studies to quantify and describe mobility behaviour. Three pillars of your PhD will be:

You shall data-mine big datasets of mobility traces (ride-hailing trip records, smart-card public transport trips, etc.) to trace behaviour shifts.
You shall conduct panel focus groups on target groups to understand stated-preferences for shared mobility. This will be further used to formulate, estimate and calibrate behavioural models.
You shall synthesize findings of WP2 to forecast the effects of control and design measure on behaviour and, reversely, to underpin control and design strategies from WP3 with travellers’ preferences.
As an ideal candidate, you should hold a Master Degree in Econometrics, Transportation or a similar STEM field. You should have the basics of behavioural models and decision making processes (discrete choice models). Candidates with a background in mathematical modelling and transport demand models and transportation enthusiasts will be given a priority. Fluent reading and writing English is essential for this position.

### We offer:


* young and friendly team,
* development opportunities,
* internationally experienced and motivated PI,
* collaboration with the international scientific community (TU Delft, KTH Sweden, TUMunich, EPFL, etc.)
* generous conference package to disseminate your results at the top conferences worldwide,
* freedom to develop into professional: data scientist, machine learning expert, simulation, computer science,
* health care and good social package,
* contact with the active urban mobility sector (Uber, ViaVan, Blees, etc.) to apply your results,
* attractive salary (**6300-7500PLN** net) with a Central European salaries at the ca. half of Western Europe prices (see e.g. numbeo.com). Which is way above the national average and allows a good quality of life in Kraków, as living expenses in Poland are significantly low compared to Western-European.
