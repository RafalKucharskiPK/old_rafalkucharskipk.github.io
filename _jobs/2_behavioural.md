3-year PhD position funded by NCN under OPUS granted [project](https://www.ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/files/listy-rankingowe/2020-03-16pfoa/streszczenia/480109-en.pdf) with competitive salary.

You will study travellers behaviour in urban mobility (WP1). In the rapidly changing landscape of urban mobility, you shall aim to track the emerging trends, identify dynamics in behaviour to precisely define market shares and target groups for future shared mobility. In the abundance of recent, corona-related research in mobility, you shall synthesize the latest theories, studies and findings to underpin our shared-mobility models. 
You shall conduct behavioural studies. Both revealed and stated preference studies to quantify and describe the mobility behaviour. 
Three pillars of your PhD will be:
1. You shall data-mine big datasets of mobility traces (ride-hailing trip records, smart-card public transport trips, etc.) to trace behaviour shifts.
2. You shall conduct panel focus groups on target groups to understand stated-preferences for shared mobility. This will be further used to formulate, estimate and calibrate behavioural models.
3. You shall synthesize findings of WP2 to forecast the effects of control and design measure on behaviour and, reversely, to underpin control and design strategies from WP3 with travellers' preferences.

As an ideal candidate, you should hold a Master Degree in Econometrics, Transportation or similar STEM field. You should have the basics of behavioural models and decision making processes (discrete choice models). Candidates with a background in mathematical modelling and transport demand models and transportation enthusiasts will be given a priority.
Fluent reading and writing English is essential for this position.
