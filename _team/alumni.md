Arek researched a novel and emerging research field - he tried to understand the impacts of futuristic RTCI: Real-time crowding information for Public Transport. He extended and developed new functionalities to BusMezzo and ended-up with remarkable stream of publications marking the new territory in Public Transport see scholar [here](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=-XyYxkoAAAAJ). Expected graduation 2021/2022.
