abstract = {Contrary to traditional transit services, supply in ridesourcing systems emerges from individual labour decisions of gig workers. The effect of decentralisation in supply on the evolution of on-demand transit services is largely unknown. To this end, we propose a dynamic model comprising of the subsequent supply-side processes: (i) initial exposure to information about the platform, (ii) a long-term registration decision, and (iii) daily participation decisions, subject to day-to-day learning based on within-day matching outcomes. We construct a series of experiments to study the effect of supply market properties and pricing strategies. We find that labour supply in ridesourcing may be non-linear and undergo several transitions, inducing significant variations in income levels and level of service over time. 
Our results provide indications that the ridesourcing market may benefit from a cap in supply and regulation of the commission fee.}

  abstract = {Since ride-hailing has become an important travel alternative in many cities worldwide, a fervent debate is underway on whether it competes with or complements public transport services. We use Uber trip data in six cities in the United States and Europe to identify the most attractive public transport alternative for each ride. We then address the following questions: (i) How does ride-hailing travel time and cost compare to the fastest public transport alternative? (ii) What proportion of ride-hailing trips do not have a viable public transport alternative? (iii) How does ride-hailing change overall service accessibility? (iv) What is the relation between demand share and relative competition between the two alternatives? Our findings suggest that the dichotomy—competing with or complementing—is false. Though the vast majority of ride-hailing trips have a viable public transport alternative, between 20% and 40% of them have no viable public transport alternative. The increased service accessibility attributed to the inclusion of ride-hailing is greater in our US cities than in their European counterparts. 
  Demand split is directly related to the relative competitiveness of travel times i.e. when public transport travel times are competitive ride-hailing demand share is low and vice-versa.}

We propose a generic method, applicable to any spatiotemporal city-bike traces, providing results meaningful to understand the general urban space attractiveness and its dynamics. With the proposed filtering (to mitigate a selection bias) and empirical cross-validation (to rule-out false-positive classifications) results effectively reveal spatial patterns of urban attractiveness.

  abstract = {Urban mobility needs alternative sustainable travel modes to keep our pandemic cities in motion. Ride-pooling, where a single vehicle is shared by more than one traveller, is not only appealing for mobility platforms and their travellers, but also for promoting the sustainability of urban mobility systems. Yet, the potential of ride-pooling rides to serve as a safe and effective alternative given the personal and public health risks considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is hitherto unknown. To answer this, we combine epidemiological and behavioural shareability models to examine spreading among ride-pooling travellers, with an application for Amsterdam. Findings are at first sight devastating, with only few initially infected travellers needed to spread the virus to hundreds of ride-pooling users. Without intervention, ride-pooling system may substantially contribute to virus spreading. Notwithstanding, we identify an effective control measure allowing to halt the spreading before the outbreaks (at 50 instead of 800 infections) without sacrificing the efficiency achieved by pooling. Fixed matches among co-travellers disconnect the otherwise dense contact network, encapsulating the virus in small communities and preventing the outbreaks.}

While recently proposed real-time solutions support online operations, algorithms to perform strategic system-wide evaluations are crucially needed. We propose an exact, replicable and demand-, rather than supply-driven algorithm for matching trips into shared rides. We leverage on delimiting our search for attractive shared rides only, which, coupled with a directed shareability multi-graph representation and efficient graph searches with predetermined node sequence, narrows the (otherwise exploding) search-space effectively enough to derive an exact solution. The proposed utility-based formulation paves the way for model integration in travel demand models, allowing for a cross-scenario sensitivity analysis, including pricing strategies and regulation policies. We apply the proposed algorithm in a series of experiments for the case of Amsterdam, where we perform a system-wide analysis of the ride-sharing performance in terms of both algorithm computations of shareability under alternative demand, network and service settings as well as behavioural parameters. In the case of Amsterdam, 3000 travellers offered a 30% discount form 1900 rides achieving an average occupancy of 1.67 and yielding a 30% vehicle-hours reduction at the cost of halving service provider revenues and a 17% increase in passenger-hours. Benchmarking against time-window constrained approaches reveals that our algorithm reduces the search-space more effectively, while yielding solutions that are substantially more attractive for travellers.}

Its negative effects upon travel experience can be potentially addressed by disseminating real-time crowding information (RTCI) to passengers. However, impacts of RTCI provision in urban PT networks remain largely unknown. This study aims to contribute by developing an extended dynamic PT simulation model that enables a thorough analysis of instantaneous RTCI consequences. In the model, RTCI is generated and disseminated across the network, and then utilised in passengers’ sequential en-route choices. A case-study demonstration of the RTCI algorithm on urban PT network model of Kraków (Poland) shows that instantaneous RTCI has the potential to improve passengers’ travel experience, although it is also susceptible to inaccuracy. RTCI provision can yield total travel utility improvements of 3% in typical PM peak-hour, with reduced impacts of the worst overcrowding effects (in terms of denied-boarding and in-vehicle travel disutility in overcrowded conditions) of 30%.}

Such studies neglect the mobility and time budget constraints on people’s accessibility. Furthermore, modal accessibility disparity studies have not considered inequality between modes during the afternoon commute. We examine accessibility to non-work activities by automobile and public transport using spatiotemporal measures that determine the number of minutes people have available to participate in activities, given time budget and activity duration constraints, rather than simply the number of activities. We examine modal accessibility disparity in Warsaw, Poland. Our two major findings are the reverse of findings in previous studies: that disparity shifts toward public transport as the activity duration increases and the travel time decreases; and that it shifts toward public transport with increasing distance away from the city center.}

abstract = {We present the Information Comply Model (ICM) which extends the framework for macroscopic within-day DTA proposed by Gentile (2016) to represent the rerouting of drivers wrt a single traffic event. Rerouting is reproduced as a two-stage process: first, drivers become aware about the event and its consequences on traffic; second, drivers may decide to change path. At each arc, unaware drivers have a probability of being informed by multiple ATIS sources (radio, VMS, mobile apps), which depends not only on devise penetration rates, but also on users space and time coordinates wrt the position and interval of the event. At each node, aware drivers, who are somehow reluctant to change, may finally modify their path based on a random rerouting utility, which is composed of expected gains and avoided losses. ICM is thus capable of representing the evolution of rerouting phenomena in time and space when the information about a traffic event and its consequences on congestion spread among drivers and onto the network. This way, ICM extends the concept of dynamic user equilibrium to a case of imperfect information related to availability and awareness rather than to individual perception, as well as to a case of bounded rationality with prudent drivers. Besides the model architecture and specification, this paper provides a workable methodology which can be applied both off-line for transport planning and in real-time for traffic management on large size networks.}

In this paper, we predict the demand pattern of New York City bikes with a low-dimensional approach utilizing three-level data clustering. We use historical demand data along with temperature and precipitation to first aggregate and then decompose data to obtain meaningful clusters. The core of this approach lies in the proposed clustering technique, which reduces the dimension of the problem and, differently from other machine learning techniques, requires limited assumptions on the model or its parameters. The proposed method allows, for the given temperature and precipitation method, to obtain expected vector of movement (mean number and direction of trips) for each zone. In this paper, we synthesize more than 17 million trips into daily and zonal vectors of movement, which combined with weather data allow forecasting of the trip demand. The method allows us to predict the demand with over 75\% accuracy, as shown in series of experiments in which various settings and parameterizations are validated against 25\% holdout data. }

The objective of this paper is to propose a method to analyse and describe cyclists’ behaviour at signalized intersections with specific focus on the multichannel (multi-lane) queue phenomenon. As we observed, cyclists form queues without a fixed-lane and FIFO discipline, for which the classical, car-oriented analytical approach becomes insufficient. Cyclists’ multichannel queueing behaviour is common and characterized by substantial degree of variability, especially in case of shorter queues which emerge regularly at cycle crossings. Although cyclist behaviour has been widely studied by transportation research community, their queueing behaviour picture is still incomplete. Namely, there is no method addressed to analyse the full scope of these phenomena and to quantify their impact on the cyclist queue performance.
To bridge this gap, we introduce the technique to observe multichannel queues and report relevant observations, which we then complement with a methodological framework to analyse obtained results and provide a complete multichannel queue description. We video-record cyclists as they enqueue to one of multiple channels, form the queue and smoothly merge into a single lane again as the queue discharges. We apply the method to analyse results from a pilot study of 160 cyclists forming 50 queues in the city of Krakow, Poland. The proposed method allows us to analyse and quantify the observed queue performance and its characteristics: the number of channels, their emergence process, channel and queue lengths, discharge process with FIFO violations, starting and discharging times. Findings from pilot study reveal that both queue length and discharge times strongly depend on queue formation process.
The contribution of this paper is the method to describe multichannel cyclist queueing behaviour, enriching current picture of bicycle flow and cyclists’ behaviour. Since the method has been developed on relatively short queues (up to 10 cyclists), findings included in this paper primarily refer to such queue sizes. Nonetheless, the method is formulated in a generic way, applicable also for longer bicycle queues. Possible practical implications are new estimates for queue lengths and discharge times - useful for bicycle infrastructure design and traffic engineering purposes.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a new method to estimate the macroscopic volume delay function (VDF) from the point speed-flow measures. Contrary to typical VDF estimation methods it allows estimating speeds also for hypercritical traffic conditions, when both speeds and flow drop due to congestion (high density of traffic flow). We employ the well-known hydrodynamic relation of fundamental diagram to derive the so-called quasi-density from measured time-mean speeds and flows. This allows formulating the VDF estimation problem with a speed being monotonically decreasing function of quasi-density with a shape resembling the typical VDF like BPR. This way we can use the actually observed speeds and propose the macroscopic VDF realistically reproducing actual speeds also for hypercritical conditions. The proposed method is illustrated with half-year measurements from the induction loop system in city of Warsaw, which measured traffic flows and instantaneous speeds of over 5 million vehicles. Although the proposed method does not overcome the fundamental limitations of static macroscopic traffic models, which cannot represent dynamic traffic phenomena like queue, spillback, wave propagation, capacity drop, and so forth, we managed to improve the VDF goodness-of-fit from  of 27% to 72% most importantly also for hypercritical conditions. Thanks to this traffic congestion in macroscopic traffic models can be reproduced more realistically in line with empirical observations.}

abstract = {Emerging on-demand sharing alternatives, in which one resource is utilised simultaneously by a circumstantial group of users, entail several challenges regarding how to coordinate such users. A very relevant case refers to how to form groups in a mobility system that offers shared rides, and how to split the costs within the travellers of a group. These are non-trivial tasks, as two objectives conflict: 1) minimising the total costs of the system, and 2) finding an equilibrium where each user is content with her assignment. Aligning both objectives is challenging, as users are not aware of the externalities induced to the rest. In this paper, we propose protocols to share the costs within a ride so that optimal solutions can also constitute equilibria. To do this, we model the situation as a non-cooperative game, which can be seen as a game-version of the well-known set cover problem. We show that the traditional notions of equilibrium in game theory (Nash and Strong) are not useful here, and prove that determining whether a Strong Equilibrium exists is an NP-Complete problem, by reducing it to the k-Exact-Cover problem. Hence, we propose three alternative equilibrium notions (stronger than Nash and weaker than Strong), depending on how users can coordinate. For each of these equilibrium notions, we propose a (possibly overcharging) cost-sharing protocol that yields the optimal solutions equilibria. Simulations for Amsterdam reveal that our protocols can achieve stable solutions that are close to the optimum, and that having a central coordinator can have a large impact.}
